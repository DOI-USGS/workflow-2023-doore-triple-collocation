    "# Extended Collocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended collocation (EC) is the generalized form of Triple Collocation (TC) for an arbitrary (3+) number of measurement/observing systems assuming none of them observed the true value. Like TC, the method makes four assumptions about the observing systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The signal and random errors are stationary (i.e., the mean of each is constant with time).\n",
    "2. No cross-correlation of errors (i.e., measurement system errors are independent of each other).\n",
    "3. Error orthogonality (i.e., the measurement system errors are independent of the true value).\n",
    "4. No error autocorrelation (i.e., the error estimates are not correlated with time).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by allowing for more than three observing systems, EC generalized the contents of assumption (2) to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cross-correlation of errors are only allowed between observing systems if each correlated observing system is also a member of at least one observing system triplet that has no cross-correlation of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, at least three observing systems must have no cross-correlation of errors and the systems whose errors are cross-correlated must be known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as TC, EC commonly assumes an affine error model relating the observation to the true value and error:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{X}_i = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i \\boldsymbol{t} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_i,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{X}_i$ are the measured values from the $i$ collocated measurement systems, $\\boldsymbol{t}$ are the measurements true values, and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_i$ are the additive random errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance Notation\n",

    "Keeping with the covariance notaction like TC, solving for the covariance of two measurement systems gives\n",

    "Solving this system of equations when $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon_i, \\varepsilon_j} \\ne 0$ is only possible with more than three observing systems.

    "\n",
    "As derived by [McColl et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1002/2014GL061322), an unbiased SNR can be derived using the TC and, thereby, EC method. This SNR shows how the error variances relate to the system's signal variance. It is derived from the scaled signal variability $\\beta_i^2\\sigma_t^2$ and error variance $\\sigma_\\varepsilon^2$ using the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\rm SNR} = \\frac{\\beta_i^2\\sigma_t^2}{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon_i}^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above equations, we can substitute in variables and reduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\rm SNR} = \\frac{\\sigma_i^2 - \\sigma_{\\varepsilon_i}^2}{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon_i}^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon_i}^2} - 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that just like the error variances, this SNR estimate will be biased (i.e., larger than reality) if cross-correlated errors exist between the measurement system triplets in the EC estimate."

    "### Multi-Dimensional Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The above function only works for a single spatial point within the collocated set of observing systems. Since most observing systems will either have a gridded map or a collection of spatial points, we can expand this function to calculate the error covariance matrix of the observations in a single function rather than having to loop over each spatial point. This simply requires expanding the computations along additional dimensions and computing the observational data covariance matrix using a function other than `cov`. In our case, we will use `einsum`, which can perform the needed matrix multiplication and summation for calculating the covariance matrix from:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\rm Cov}(\\boldsymbol{X}_i, \\boldsymbol{X}_j) = \\frac{1}{N-1}(\\boldsymbol{X}_i - \\bar{X_i})(\\boldsymbol{X}_j - \\bar{X_j})^T$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of points in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also for this expanded function, we will add an optional input that gives a user more control over how the independent measuring systems are combined. In the function for a single collocated point above, this is specified by which system within correlated pairs come first in the input. However, a user may need more control when multiple correlated systems are input. For example, assume we have five measuring systems with two correlated pairs. Let's call them `A-E`, where `A` and `D` are correlated and `B` and `E` are correlated. With the above function, we could input the data sets in order as `(AD)(BE)C`, where the parenthesis help distinguish correlated pairs. This would result in independent system calculations of `ABC`, `DBC`, `AEC` to derived the needed error variances. However, what if we weren't sure that `AE` or `DB` were independent, but were sure `DE` are independent? With the above function, we couldn't account for this in the calculation. Therefore, we include an option input allowing for a user to specify which other two measuring systems should be considered independent from the one currently being calculated."
