    "# Extended Collocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended collocation (EC) is the generalized form of Triple Collocation (TC) for an arbitrary (3+) number of measurement/observing systems assuming none of them observed the true value. Like TC, the method makes four assumptions about the observing systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The signal and random errors are stationary (i.e., the mean of each is constant with time).\n",
    "2. No cross-correlation of errors (i.e., measurement system errors are independent of each other).\n",
    "3. Error orthogonality (i.e., the measurement system errors are independent of the true value).\n",
    "4. No error autocorrelation (i.e., the error estimates are not correlated with time).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by allowing for more than three observing systems, EC generalized the contents of assumption (2) to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cross-correlation of errors are only allowed if each member of the observing system pairs with cross-correlated errors is also a member of at least one observing system triplet that has no cross-correlation of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, at least three observing systems must have no cross-correlation of errors and the systems whose errors are cross-correlated must be known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as TC, EC commonly assumes an affine error model relating the observation to the true value and error:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{X}_i = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i \\boldsymbol{t} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_i$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{X}_i$ are the measured values from the $i$ collocated measurement systems, $\\boldsymbol{t}$ are the measurements true values, and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_i$ are the additive random errors.\n",
